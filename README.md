# pygobject Homebrew Tap

## How do I use it?

### Installation

Add the tap to homebrew:

`brew tap gmelikov/pygobject`

Install as usual:

`brew install pygobject`

Because the binary bottles are no longer hosted by Homebrew, the formula will build from source.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall:

`brew uninstall pygobject`

To remove this tap:

`brew untap gmelikov/pygobject`
